## Concept
The term 'String', used in programming to indicate a 'string of characters', first came into regular usage in the mid 1960's, as languages such as Lisp allowed textual data processing to flourish.  A more general meaning, to order a series of mathematical values, as if beads on a string, dates possibly to the 1930's. 

--

- We will reframe our existing understanding of Strings in light of our newfound mastery of object-oriented programming.

# String Class

--

## Instantiation
Like all objects in Java, Strings can be instantiated using the `new` operator and passing the **constructor** a `char` array.
```java
char[] charr = { 'w','o','r','r','y',' ', 'n','o','t' };
String myMessageToYou = new String(charr);
```

--

- To make Strings appear more like primitive values, i.e. to simplify their overly verbose usage, Java offers syntactic sugar for their instantiation.

```java
String myMessageToYou = "worry not";
```

---

## Many functions return Strings
Rather than directly instantiating a String object, there are many functions in the Java API that instantiate new String object's on our behalf, e.g.

--

- `String myMessageToYou = "worry" + " " + "not";`

--

- `myMessageToYou.concat(", weary heads");`

--

- `myMessageToYou.substring( 0, myMessageToYou.indexOf(' ') );`

--

- `myMessageToYou.toUpperCase();`

--

- `myMessageToYou.toUpperCase().toLowerCase();`

--

- `myMessageToYou.replace("worry", "fear");`

--

- `String.format( " '%s', he said to the child. ", myMessageToYou )`

---

## .toString( ) methods
And every class can optionally declare a method named `toString()` that indicates how an object of that class should be converted to a String.

--

```java
public class Moped {
    // ...
    public String toString() {
        return String.format(
            "A moped at %s & %s facing %s", 
            this.getStreet(), 
            this.getAvenue(), 
            this.getOrientation() 
        )
    }
    // ...
}
```

--

```java
// ... assume we instantiated a Moped object ...
System.out.println( myMoped ); // output it as a String
```

---

template: string

## .toString( ) methods (continued)
Even if you don't define a `.toString()` method in your custom classes, one exists automatically anyway.

--

- How does this work?!

--

- Every object automatically *inherits* some properties and methods from the oldest ancestor class in the Java API named `Object`.

--

- `toString()` is one of those.

--

- Here is `Object`'s implementation of its `toString()` method.
```java
//...
public String toString() {
        return getClass().getName() + "@" + Integer.toHexString(hashCode());
}
//...
```

## What's inside a String?
There are several useful functions for investigating the internals of a String.

--

- `int num = myMessageToYou.length();`

--

- `char c = myMessageToYou.charAt(5);`

--

- `char[] charr = myMessageToYou.toCharArray();`

--

- `int num = myMessageToYou.indexOf(" ");`

--

- `boolean isInThere = myMessageToYou.contains("not");`

--

- `boolean startsRight = myMessageToYou.startsWith("worry");`

--

- `boolean endsRight = myMessageToYou.endsWith("not");`

---

## Comparing two Strings
Comparing two strings can be done in a few different styles.

--

- `(myMessageToYou == "worry not")`

--

- `myMessageToYou.equals("worry not")`

--

- `myMessageToYou.equalsIgnoreCase("WORRY NOT")`

---

name: immutability

# Immutability

--

## Concept
String objects are immutable - once they have been instantiated, their contents cannot be changed.

--

- Creating immutable objects is quite simple in Java.

--

- One can create a class with a constructor that sets one or more private properties.

--

- So long as there are no public `setter` methods provided, those private properties can be frozen at their initial values.

--

```java
public class ImmutableDog {
    public ImmutableDog( String name, String breed, int age ) {
        this.setName(name);
        this.setBreed(breed);
        this.setAge(age);
    }
    // ... assume we define private setter methods
}
```

---

name: character

# Character Class

--

## Concept
The Character class is a *wrapper class*, used to do processing and analysis of char primitive values, e.g.

--

- `char[] a = "my, my".toCharArray();`

--

- `Character x = new Character(a[4]);`

--

- `x.equals('m')` -> true, of course

--

- `Character.isDigit(a[3])` -> false, of course

--

- `Character.isLetter(a[3])` -> true, of course

--

- `Character.toUpperCase(a[3])` -> 'L'

--

- `Character.isUpperCase(a[3])` -> false

---

name: string-builder

# StringBuilder Class

--

## Concept
Since Strings are immutable, concatening many Strings together or modifying the contents of a String tends to require a lot of code and more memory than it should.  Enter StringBuilder.

--

- **StringBuilder** is an easy-to-use, memory-efficient class for mutating text.

--

- `StringBuilder myBuilder = new StringBuilder("Welcome");`

--

- `int num = myBuilder.length();`

--

- `myBuilder.append(" to class!");` // it's mutable!
welcome to this wonderful class
--

- `myBuilder.insert( 11, "this wonderful " );` // it's easy to insert

--

- `myBuilder.delete( 16, 25 );` // it's easy to delete parts

--

- `myBuilder.reverse();` // because we can
---

template: string-builder

## Extracting the String from StringBuilder
Converting the contents of a StringBuilder to a regular String is a facile matter.

--

- `myBuilder.toString()`

--

- `myBuilder.substring(11, 15)`

You now have increased your knowledge of the String and related classes as examples of typical object-oriented Java classes.
