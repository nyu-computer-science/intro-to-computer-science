# Overview

--

## Concept
[Processing](https://processing.org) is a code framework for animation.  It is also the name of a non-profit foundation that attempts to teach programming and spread software literacy.

--

- The original concept - an animation framework that allows new coders to visualize programming concepts and have fun - has proven popular, not just with newbies.

--

- First Java-only, it has now been ported to other popular languages, including Python and Javascript.

--

- The Javascript version, named p5.js, is debatably now the most popular implementation, allowing developers to easily create web-based animations, data visualizations, and games.

# Installation

--

## Concept
Processing consists of a few Java Archive (JAR) files that you can import into your code.

--

- A JAR file is a package file, like zip, that contains Java class definitions plus some settings.

--

- Once we properly import these Processing class definitions into our project, our code will be able to reference and use those Processing classes.

--

- How we import the JAR files depends on which Integrated Development Environment (IDE) we are using.

--

- You are advised to use either [Eclipse](https://eclipse.org) or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com).

## Download Processing
Go to the [Processing web site](https://processing.org) and download the appropriate version for your system.

--

- Install it as you would any other application.

--

- You will now have the stand-alone Processing application, which includes the file we need named `core.jar`.

--

- To locate `core.jar` on Mac, Cntrl-click on the application in Finder and click `Show Package Contents`.  Then find the file within at `Contents/Java/core.jar`

--

- To locate `core.jar` on Windows, find the file at `PATH_TO_PROCESSING/core/library/core.jar`, where `PATH_TO_PROCESSING` is the directory where it is installed.

--

- Copy this `core.jar` file and place it somewhere temporarily convenient, such as the `Desktop`.

## Downgrade to Java SE 8
If you are running a relatively recent version of Java, you must downgrade to Java SE version 8.

--

- Visit the [Java SE 8 download page](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk8-downloads.html).

--

- Download and run the installer for the version appropriate for your system. 

--

- You will be asked to log in - feel free to create an account with your email address, but you may also be interested in using shared credentials available on [bugmenot.com](http://bugmenot.com/view/oracle.com)

## Set Up Eclipse
Processing can be integrated into the popular Eclipse IDE relatively simply.

- Open Eclipse and go to Preferences

--

- Within Eclipse's Preferences, search for the term, `jdk`... results will appear in the left side bar.

--

- Click the option titled, `Installed JREs`

--

- In the `Installed JREs` settings, click the `Add` button.

--

- Select `Standard VM`

---

## Set Up Eclipse (continued)

--

- In the `JRE home` field, find the directory of your newly-installed JRE 8. On Mac it is most likely something like '/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_241.jdk/Contents/Home' on Windows, it will be similar - check the path of your existing JRE and find it near there.

--

- In the `JRE name` field, enter a custom name, such as 'Java SE 8 [1.8.0.241]', or something similar.

--

- Click the `Finish` button to complete the installation.

--

- In the `Installed JREs` settings again, make sure the newly installed JRE has the checkmark next to it checked.

--

- Click the `Apply and Close` button to complete the change to the JRE.

Hopefully this has been a pleasant foray into creating frame-based animations in Java using the Processing framework.

- Thank you.  Bye.
