# Overview

--

## Concept

[Processing](https://processing.org) is a code framework for animation. It is also the name of a non-profit foundation that attempts to teach programming and spread software literacy.

--

- The original concept - an animation framework that allows new coders to visualize programming concepts and have fun - has proven popular, not just with newbies.

--

- Initially Java-only, Processing has now been _ported_ to other popular languages, including [Python](https://py.processing.org/) and [Javascript](https://p5js.org/).

--

- The Javascript version, named p5.js, is debatably now the most popular implementation, allowing developers to easily create web-based animations, data visualizations, and games.

---

name: installation

# Installation

--

## Concept

Processing consists of a few Java Archive (JAR) files that you can import into your code.

--

- A JAR file is a package file, like zip, that contains Java class definitions plus some settings.

--

- Once we properly import these Processing class definitions into our project, our code will be able to reference and use those Processing classes.

--

- How we import the JAR files depends on which Integrated Development Environment (IDE) we are using.

--

- The Processing team produces its own IDE, which is overly simple (albeit intentionally so) for our purposes - do not use it.

--

- You are advised to use either the [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) or [Eclipse](https://eclipse.org) IDE.

---

template: installation

## Download Processing

Go to the [Processing web site](https://processing.org) and download the appropriate version for your system.

--

- Install it as you would any other application.

--

- You will now have the stand-alone Processing application, which includes the file we need named `core.jar`.

--

- To locate `core.jar` on Mac, Cntrl-click on the application in Finder and click `Show Package Contents`. Then find the file within at `Contents/Java/core.jar`

--

- To locate `core.jar` on Windows, find the file at `PATH_TO_PROCESSING/core/library/core.jar`, where `PATH_TO_PROCESSING` is the directory where it is installed.

--

- Copy this `core.jar` file and place it somewhere temporarily convenient, such as the `Desktop`.

---

template: installation

## Downgrade to Java SE 8

If you are running a relatively recent version of Java, you must downgrade to Java SE version 8.

--

- Visit the [Java SE 8 download page](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk8-downloads.html).

--

- Download and run the installer for the version appropriate for your system.

--

- You will be asked to log in - feel free to create an account with your real email address, but you may also be interested in using shared credentials available on [bugmenot.com](http://bugmenot.com/view/oracle.com) or using a public email address from a service like [mailinator.com](https://mailinator.com)

---

template: installation

## Set Up Eclipse

Processing can be integrated into the popular [Eclipse IDE](https://eclipse.org) relatively simply.

- Open Eclipse and go to Preferences

--

- Within Eclipse's Preferences, search for the term, `jdk`... results will appear in the left side bar.

--

- Click the option titled, `Installed JREs`

--

- In the `Installed JREs` settings, click the `Add` button.

--

- Select `Standard VM`

---

template: installation

## Set Up Eclipse (continued)

- In the `JRE home` field, find the directory of your newly-installed JRE 8. On Mac it is most likely something like '/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_241.jdk/Contents/Home' on Windows, it will be similar - check the path of your existing JRE and find it near there.

--

- In the `JRE name` field, enter a custom name, such as 'Java SE 8 [1.8.0.241]', or something similar.

--

- Click the `Finish` button to complete the installation.

--

- In the `Installed JREs` settings again, make sure the newly installed JRE has the checkmark next to it checked.

--

- Click the `Apply and Close` button to complete the change to the JRE.

---

template: installation

## Set Up Eclipse (continued again)

Assuming Eclipse has been configured to run Java SE 8, we can easily install Processing's `core.jar` file as a dependency of any Eclipse project.

--

- Create a new Java Project within Eclipse.

--

- Drag the `core.jar` file from wherever you saved it, and drop it into the `src` directory of the Eclipse Java project.

--

- Right-click (or Cntrl-click) on the `core.jar` file in Eclipse and select 'Add to Build Path'.

--

- You are now ready to use Processing's library in your project.

---

template: installation

## Set Up Visual Studio Code

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) is an increasingly popular language-agnostic IDE by Microsoft. Set up a Java Project with Processing as follows.

--

- **Install the Java Extension Pack** - do this by clicking the Extensions icon in the left side bar, search for `Java Extension Pack`, click on the search result, and click the 'Install' button.

--

- **Create a new Java Project** - do this by opening up VS Code's `View` -> `Command Palette` menu option and type `Java: Create Java Project` into the Command Palette's text field. Select a directory where you wish to house your project, and enter a name for the project with no spaces in the name.

--

- **Add the core.jar file to the project** - do this by creating a directory named `lib` within your new project's main directory and drag-and-drop `core.jar` from wherever you saved it into this `lib` directory.

---

template: installation

## Set Up Visual Studio Code (continued)

- **Configure the project's settings file** - if your project does not already have a sub-directory named `.vscode`, create one and create a file therein named `settings.json`. If your project already has this directory and file, open it up. Enter the following code into the `.settings` file and save:

```javascript
{
        "java.project.referencedLibraries": [
            "lib/**/*.jar",
        ]
}
```

--

- **Configure the Java classpath** - open a file named `.classpath` in your project's main directory. This is a hidden file, so you may not see it in the file listing, but find a way to open it. Add the following to line and save:

```xml
<classpathentry kind="lib" path="lib/core.jar"/>
```

--

- You are now ready to use Processing's library in your project.

---

name: run

# Run a Program

--

## What we need to do in code

To use Processing, you must...

--

- import the classes within the `processing.core` package into your own project code

--

- make sure your custom class inherits properties and methods from the class, `PApplet`

--

- pass the `PApplet.main()` method the full name of your custom class

--

- set up lifecycle methods named `settings()`, `setup()`, and `draw()`

---

template: run

## Starter code

For example, enter the following starter code within the `src/fb1258` directory in a file named `MyClass.java`.

```java
package fb1258;

import processing.core.*;

public class Circle extends PApplet {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
		PApplet.main("fb1258.Circle");
    }
    public void settings() {
		this.size(600, 400); // open a window that is 600x400, diameter=100
    }
    public void setup() {
    }
    public void draw() {
		  this.ellipse(250, 150, 100, 100); // draw an ellipse at x=250, y=150
    }
}
```

---

template: run

## On syntax

You will note in our starter code that we use the `this` keyword as a prefix when referring to instance methods and instance properties. This is good code style.

```java
this.ellipse(250, 150, 100, 100);
```

--

- If you review any of the official Processing documentation or example code, you will note that they do not use the `this` keyword at all.

```java
ellipse(250, 150, 100, 100);
```

--

- Processing's goal is to avoid showing anything remotely object-oriented in their code so as to not scare newbies.

--

- _You_ should always prefix instance properties and methods with `this` and static properties and methods with the class name.

---

template: run

## Run it!

Run this program - if it works, you are in good shape!

--

- If using **Eclipse**, run by clicking the green run icon at the top of the window.

--

- If using **VS Code**, run by either clicking the `Run` link that appears above the `main` method in the editor or clicking the `Debug` icon in VS Code's left icon bar and then click the green run icon in the Debug panel.

---

name: lifecycle

# Lifecycle Methods

--

## Concept

The three methods we added to our code are automatically called by PApplet's code at certain times in the life of the program.

--

- [settings()](https://processing.org/reference/settings_.html) is called once at the start of the program in order to set up the size of the application window that pops open.

--

- [setup()](https://processing.org/reference/setup_.html) is called once at the start of the program and can optionally be used to pre-load any images or other media that might be used later in the application.

--

- [draw()](https://processing.org/reference/draw_.html) is initially called directly after `setup()` and on an automatic timer every `60` seconds thereafter until the program stops animating. The code placed within this method is used to draw the frames of the animation.

---

name: animation

# Animation

--

## Concept

In frame-based animation, objects are redrawn in rapid succession at slightly different locations on the screen in order to give the illusion of movement.

````java
package fb1258;
import processing.core.*;
public class CircleSliding extends PApplet {

	private int x = 250; // starting x position of ellipse
	private int y = 150; // starting y position of ellipse

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        PApplet.main("fb1258.CircleSliding");
    }
    public void settings() {
        this.size(600, 400); /* open a window that is 600x400 */
    }
    public void draw() {
		this.background(0, 0, 0); // fill screen with black (R,G,B = 0,0,0)
		this.fill(255, 255, 255); // paint with white (R,G,B = 255,255,255)
		this.ellipse(this.x, this.y, 100, 100); // draw ellipse with fill color
		this.x++; // next time draw ellipse at slightly different location
		this.y++;
    }
}```

---

name: functions

# Inherited functions

--

## Drawing
PApplet bestows a variety of useful functions upon our custom class, including many functions for drawing shapes to the screen.

--

- [ellipse(x, y, width, height)](https://processing.org/reference/ellipse_.html) - draws an ellipse

--

- [rect(x, y, width, height)](https://processing.org/reference/rect_.html) - draws a rectangle

--

- [line(x1, y1, x2, y2)](https://processing.org/reference/line_.html) - draws a line

--

- [loadImage(stringPathToImageFile)](https://processing.org/reference/loadImage_.html) - returns a `PImage` object that can be passed to the image() function

--

- [image(pImageObject, x, y)](https://processing.org/reference/image_.html) - draws any pImage object to the screen

--

- [textSize(intFontSize)](https://processing.org/reference/textSize_.html) - sets the size of any text to be drawn

--

- [text(someString, x, y)](https://processing.org/reference/text_.html) - draws text to the screen

---

template: functions

## Colors
There are several color-related properties that can be set using several appropriately-named functions...

--

- [background(r, g, b)](https://processing.org/reference/background_.html) - fills the entire screen with a solid color

--

- [fill(r, g, b)](https://processing.org/reference/fill_.html) - the color to use next time a shape is drawn to the screen

--

- [noFill()](https://processing.org/reference/noFill_.html) - don't use any fill for the next shape drawn to the screen

--

- [stroke(r, g, b)](https://processing.org/reference/stroke_.html) - the color to use for the outline around the next shape drawn to the screen

--

- [noStroke()](https://processing.org/reference/noStroke_.html) - don't use any stroke for the next shape drawn to the screen


---

template: functions

## ... and much more
These were just the easy functions to get started with.

--

- There are many more functions inherited by your class from PApplet - see [the full reference](https://processing.org/reference/)

--

- There is also a large ecosystem of 3rd-party libraries that add additional functionality not present in Processing itself - see [the official list of add-on libraries](https://processing.org/reference/libraries/)

---

name: events

# Responding to Events

--

## Mouse clicks
Processing's code can automatically call a function in your code anytime the user clicks a mouse.

--

- To take advantage of this, create a function named `mouseClicked()` in your code.

--

- This function will be called immediately *after* the user clicks the mouse.

--

- Within this function, you can access the `x` and `y` coordinate at which the user clicked the mouse via the `this.mouseX` and `this.mouseY` properties of objects of your class.

--

```java
public void mouseClicked() {
        System.out.printf("clicked at %d, %d", this.mouseX, this.mouseY);
}
````

---

template: events

## Other mousing around

Processing will also call other functions you define for a variety of other mouse-driven events.

--

- a `mouseMoved()` function will be called whenever the user moves the mouse.

--

- a `mousePressed()` function will be called whenever the user presses the mouse.

--

- a `mouseReleased()` function will be called whenever the user releases the mouse button.

--

- a `mouseDragged()` function will be called whenever the user clicks and drags the mouse.

---

template: events

## Keyboard events

Processing can respond to various keyboard-driven events if you define functions to handle them.

--

- a `keyPressed()` function will be called whenever the user presses a key.

--

- a `keyReleased()` function will be called whenever the user releases a previously-pressed key.

--

- a property named `this.key` is always set to the most recently pressed key's numeric ASCII code.

--

- for keys that do not have ASCII codes, such as BACKSPACE, TAB, ENTER, RETURN, ESC, UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT, and DELETE, the property `this.keyCode` contains a code for which key was pressed.

--

- these non-ASCII `keyCode` values can be compared to constants Processing supplies, named after the key they represent, e.g.

```java
if (this.keyCode == UP) { /* ... */ }
```

---

name: multiple-classes

# Multiple Classes

--

## One window, please

When writing programs that use the Processing library, we must have a custom class that inherits from PApplet. But what do we do when we have more than one custom class?

--

- The PApplet class includes code to open an app window when it is instantiated. So every class we define that inherits from PApplet will also pop open a window when instantiated. You probably don't want that.

--

- **Only one custom class in a given project should inherit from PApplet**.

--

- Do not have more than one class do so or you will have many unrelated windows pop open unexpectedly.

---

template: multiple-classes

## Passing around PApplet

It might be the case that you desire to use one of PApplet's functions from within a class that does not inherit from PApplet.

--

- To do so, simply pass an object that does inherit from PApplet to that other class.

--

- For example, let's say we have a program that pops open a window and draws a circle and a square that move around randomly on the screen.

--

- Following good object-oriented design principles of **encapsulation** and **abstraction**, we would want separate objects for the circle and the rectangle - each thing should be an object.

--

- Furthermore, we would want each the circle object and the rectangle object to _move and draw themselves_ around the screen.

--

- How can they draw themselves if only one class can inherit from PApplet?

---

template: multiple-classes

## Passing around PApplet (continued)

Define one class that inherits from PApplet, and have it pass itself to the other objects.

```java
// ... insert the package and import statements here...
public class App extends PApplet {

  private Circle circle; // a custom class we will define
  private Rectangle rectangle; // a custom class we will define

  // ... insert the main method and settings method go here.

  public void setup() {
    // instantiate the two objects... notice we pass *this*
    this.circle = new Circle(100, 100, this);
    this.rectangle = new Rectangle(100, 100, this);
  }

  public void draw() {
    // have the two objects draw themselves to the screen
    this.circle.draw();
    this.rectangle.draw();
  }
}
```

---

template: multiple-classes

## Passing around PApplet (continued again)

Within the `Circle` and `Rectangle` class constructors, we accept an `App` object that we caan use to draw to the screen.

```java
// ... insert the package statement and any imports here ...
public class Circle {
  private int x; // the x coordinate of this object
  private int y; // the y coordinate of this object
  private App app; // a property that will hold an App object, which inherits from PApplet

  // notice that we accept an App object into the constructor and store it into this object
  public Circle(int x, int y, App app) {
    this.x = x; // ideally we would use a setter that performs some validation
    this.y = y; // ideally we would use a setter that performs some validation
    this.app = app; // this is the trick - store the App object!
  }

  public void draw() {
    this.x = this.x + 2 // change the x coordinate a bit
    this.app.ellipse(this.x, this.y, 100, 100); // using PApplet's draw method!
  }

}
```
