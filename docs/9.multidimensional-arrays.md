# Multidimensional Arrays
> The universe is not a stagnant place where technology stands still and only the few govern its destiny. Rather, it is a multidimensional dynamic entity that interacts with all things, even the very smallest. And what part we each place in it and the effect we have on it is a matter of our own choice.

## Concept

Multidimensional arrays are arrays that store other arrays nested within them.
- An array that stores arrays is called a two-dimensional array
- An array that stores arrays that themselves store arrays is called a three-dimensional array
- An array that stores arrays that themselves store arrays that in turn also store arrays is called a four-dimensional array
- and so on.

## Two-dimensional example

A two-dimensional array - an array that stores inner arrays of type `int`.
- Note the **two** sets of square brackets after the data type declaration.
```java
int[][] numbers = {
    { 10, 9, 8 },
    { 1, 2, 3 },
    { 6, 5, 4 },
}
```

To output the third value in the second inner array - 3
```java
System.out.println( numbers[1][2] );
```

## Three-dimensional example

A three-dimensional array - an array that stores inner arrays of type `String`.
- Note the **three** sets of square brackets after the data type declaration.
```java
String[][][] words = {
    {
        {"who", "what", "when", "why", "how"},
        {"whither", "whence", "wherefore"}
    },
    {
        {"there", "that", "then"},
        {"thence", "hence", "heretofore"}
    }
}
```

To output the third value in the second child array of the first inner array - 'wherefore'.
```java
System.out.println( words[0][1][2] );
```

## It's all a lie

Multidimensional arrays do not exist in Java.

---

template: truth-1
name: truth-1a

- In a true multidimensional array, all elements within the array occupy a continuous block of memory.

---

template: truth-1a
name: truth-1b

- This is not the case in Java.

---

template: truth-1b
name: truth-1c

- Java two-dimensional arrays are arrays of pointers - references to other memory locations where the inner arrays are kept, separately from the outer array.

You now have a basic understanding of multidimensional arrays - especially two-dimensional arrays - in Java.
- Thank you.  Bye.
