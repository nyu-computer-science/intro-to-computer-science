# Assumptions

---

# Assumptions
## Ability to execute Java programs
You will need to have the [Java Development Kit](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/) installed.

---

# Assumptions
## Ability to run *NIX commands
In order to run Unix or Linux commands, you will need a terminal emulator:
- OS X users already have the Terminal app we will use for this purpose.
- Windows users must have [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/) installed.

---

# Assumptions
## Ability to edit text
Computer programming code is plain text.  In order to edit code, you will need a decent plain text editor program.
- Install [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/), a freee good quality plain text editor.
- Sublime Text is freeware, but periodically will ask for donations. You are not required to donate.

Warnings:
- Never use SimpleText on OS X to edit code
- Never use Notepad on Windows to edit code
- Do not use Microsoft Word or Google Docs to edit code

---

# Assumptions
## Ability to edit text
If you want to have extra fun with the *NIX command line, use Emacs instead of Sublime Text.
- Emacs is a plain text editor that can be run from the command line.

Emacs functionality depends upon a lot of keyboard shortcut combinations.  The following will get you started:
- `Ctrl-x`, `Ctrl-s` to save a file
- `Ctrl-x`, `Ctrl-c` to quit

# Navigating with *NIX

---

# Navigating with *NIX
## Overview
Unix commands are necessary in order to be able to navigate directories/folders in a UNIX-like system.
- all Unix commands are run in the command-line interface, such as that offered by Terminal on OS X or Git Bash on Windows.

Review [basic Unix commands](https://knowledge.kitchen/Basic_UNIX/Linux_file_management).

# Navigating with *NIX
## Where am I?
At any point in time, you are actively within one specific directory.  To determine which directory that is at any point, run the `pwd` command:

```console
foo@bar$ pwd
/Users/foo
```

---

# Navigating with *NIX
## Where am I?
At any point in time, you are actively within one specific directory, known as the current working directory.  To determine which directory that is at any point, run the `pwd` command:

```console
foo@bar$ pwd
/Users/foo
```

Read more about the [current working directory](https://knowledge.kitchen/Basic_computer_concepts#The_working_directory).

---

# Navigating with *NIX
## How do I get to the top?
To navigate to the top-most directory of your hard drive, known as the "root directory", use the `cd` command with the `/` symbol indicating root directory as the desired destination.

```console
foo@bar$ cd /
foo@bar$ pwd
/
```

The current working directory is now the root directory.

---

# Navigating with *NIX
## How do I see what directories and files are within the current working directory?
Use the `ls` command to show non-hidden files and directories that are within the current working directory.

```console
foo@bar$ ls
dir1    dir4    file2
dir2    dir5    file3
dir3    file1   file4
```

---

# Navigating with *NIX
## How do I see what hidden directories and files are within the current working directory?
Hidden files and directoriess simply begin with the '.' character.  To view a listing of files and directories including them, use the `a` flag on the `ls` command.

```console
foo@bar$ ls -a
.hidden_dir1    dir1    dir4    file2
.hidden_dir2    dir2    dir5    file3
.hidden_file1   dir3    file1   file4
```

---

# Navigating with *NIX
## How do I see more information about each of the files and directories in the listing?
To view a listing of files and directories including metadata about each item, use the `l` flag on the `ls` command.

```console
foo@bar$ ls -a
drwx------+ 10 foo  bar   320 Sep  4 10:41 dir1 
drwx------+ 19 foo  bar   608 Aug 30 21:38 dir2
drwx------+  8 foo  bar   256 Nov 27  2017 dir3
drwx------+  4 foo  bar   128 Dec 31  2016 dir4
drwx------+ 19 foo  bar   611 Aug 21 21:38 dir5
-rwx------+ 10 foo  bar   320 Sep  4 10:41 file1
-rwx------+ 19 foo  bar   608 Aug 30 21:38 file2
-rwx------+  8 foo  bar   256 Nov 27  2017 file3
-rwx------+  4 foo  bar   128 Dec 31  2016 file4
```

To include hidden files in the listing, combine the `-l` and `-a` flags.
```console
foo@bar$ ls -la
...
```

# Navigating with *NIX
## How do I drill down?
To navigate to sub-directory that is within the current directory, use the `cd` command with the name of the sub-directory that is the desired destination.

```console
foo@bar$ cd bar
foo@bar$ pwd
/bar
```

---

# Navigating with *NIX
## How do I jump to a directory from anywhere
If you kmow the full path of a directory you want to navigate to, type it after the `cd` command.

```console
foo@bar$ pwd
/bar/baz
foo@bar$ cd /Users/foo/Documents/my_favorite_ice_cream
foo@bar$ pwd
/Users/foo/Documents/my_favorite_ice_cream
```
