# Assumptions

template: assumptions

## Ability to run *NIX commands
In order to run Unix or Linux commands, you will need a terminal emulator:
- OS X users already have the Terminal app we will use for this purpose.
- Windows users must have [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/) installed.

---

template: assumptions

## Ability to execute Java programs
You will need to have the [Java Development Kit](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/) (JDK) installed.

If you have any terminal emulators open (such as Terminal or Git Bash), close them and reopen them after installing the JDK.

## Understanding of plain text
Plain text is a term frequently used to mean one data on a computer that is represented as codes in the ASCII encoding system or the Unicode encoding system, a successor to ASCII.

These coding systems map specific numeric codes to every text character.  For example, the letter `a` is 97, `b` is 98, and so on and so forth.

## Understanding of plain text
When you as a human see plain text on your screen or type text characters on your keyboard, chances are the computer behind the scenes will store that text's numeric codes (in binary) according to one of these two encoding systems.  

A plain text file is a file that has nothing but numeric codes that map out to characters in one of these systems.  Unicode is today's standard and includes all the Anglocentric characters ASCII did, plus characters of all other languages.

## Ability to edit plain text
Computer programming code is plain text.  In order to edit code, you will need a decent plain text editor program.
- Install [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/), a free good quality plain text editor.
- Sublime Text is freeware, but periodically will ask for donations. You are not required to donate.

---

## Warnings about text editor quality
- Never use TextEdit on OS X to edit code.
- Never use Notepad on Windows to edit code.
- Do not use Microsoft Word or Google Docs to edit code
- Beware of Emacs, lest you find yourself forever dreaming of keyboard shortcuts.

## Command line text editors
Emacs is a plain text editor that can be run from the command line.  Vim is another.

If you want to have the most fun with the *NIX command line, use Emacs instead of Sublime Text.

---

## Emacs shortcuts
Emacs functionality depends upon a lot of keyboard shortcut combinations.  The following will get you started:
- `Ctrl-x Ctrl-s` to save a file
- `Ctrl-x Ctrl-c` to quit emacs

Learn more shortcuts with an [emacs cheat sheet](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=emacs+cheat+sheet&t=brave&ia=cheatsheet&iax=1).

## Create a file
Create a new plain text file somewhere you know you can find it later.

Make a file in a new sub-directory of your user account 'home' directory (using the `~` shortcut to navigate there):
```console
foo@bar$ cd ~
foo@bar$ mkdir first_try
foo@bar$ cd first_try
foo@bar$ touch MyFirstJavaProgram.java
```

---

## Add starter Java code to the file

Edit the text file you just created using a text editor of your choice.
```console
foo@bar$ emacs MyFirstJavaProgram.java
```

Add the following code:
```java
public class MyFirstJavaProgram {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		// put the main contents of your program below here
		System.out.println("Welcome to Java from the command line!");
		// put the main contents of your program above here
	}
}
```

## Save your file

If you are using the emacs editor, press `Ctrl-x Ctrl-S` to save, then `Ctrl-x Ctrl-c` to quit.

If using any other graphical user interface editor, just save the ordinary way.

## Compile the Java source code

Java code must be compiled to byte code before it can be run.  Use the `javac` command to do this.
```console
foo@bar$ javac MyFirstJavaProgram.java
```

Note the full name of the .java file to compile.

The compiler will now have automatically created a file named MyFirstJavaProgram.class in the same directory.

---

template: starter-code

## Execute the Java byte code

The Java byte code can now be executed by the JVM, Java's interpreter, using the `java` command.
```console
foo@bar$ java MyFirstJavaProgram
Welcome to Java from the command line!
```

Note the command does not require the .java or .class file extension.

## Add a package
Java code can be organized into "packages" of related files.  

Add a similar package declaration to your source code file in an editor of your choice, but replace `fb1258` with your own NYU Net ID.
```java
package edu.nyu.cs.fb1258;

public class MyFirstJavaProgram {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		// put the main contents of your program below here
		System.out.println("Welcome to Java from the command line!");
		// put the main contents of your program above here
	}
}
```

## Move the file to the proper location
Sadly, with a package identifier, the .java and .class files must now be located in a directory that matches the package or the JVM will not execute them.

Create an appropriate set of sub-directories, and move both files at once (replace `fb1258` with yoru own NYU Net ID):
```console
foo@bar$ mkdir edu
foo@bar$ mkdir edu/nyu
foo@bar$ mkdir edu/nyu/cs
foo@bar$ mkdir edu/nyu/cs/fb1258
foo@bar$ mv MyFirstJavaProgram.* edu/nyu/cs/fb1258
```

Of course there is a way to create all these sub-directories at once using the `p` flag to the `mkdir` command:
```console
foo@bar$ mkdir -p edu/nyu/cs/fb1258
foo@bar$ mv MyFirstJavaProgram.* edu/nyu/cs/fb1258
```


---

## Recompile the Java source code.
Sadder still, the Java source code must now be re-compiled, since the byte code is no longer up to date.

```console
foo@bar$ javac edu/nyu/cs/fb1258/MyFirstJavaProgram.java
```

This will overwrite the file named `MyFirstJavaProgram.class` in the appropriate directory.

---

template: better-code

## Re-execute the Java byte code
At this point, you have two files named `MyFirstJavaProgram.java` (source code) and `MyFirstJavaProgram.class` (byte code) in the directory `edu/nyu/cs/fb1258`, where `fb1258` is replaced with your own NYU Net ID.

Now try running it.  Here we will tell the JVM that it should look in the current working directory (nicknamed `.`) and any sub-directories for the appropriate .class files within the indicated package.

```console
foo@bar$ java -classpath . edu.nyu.cs.fb1258.MyFirstJavaProgram
Better welcome to Java from the command line!
```

Use package identifiers from now on in all work.

We can now use the command line to write and compile Java source code into Java byte code and then execute that byte code using the JVM interpreter.
