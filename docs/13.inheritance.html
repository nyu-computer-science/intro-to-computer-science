# Inheritance & Polymorphism

# Overview

--

## Concept
**Inheritance** is a mechanism for basing one object or a class on another object or class when the two objects or classes include similar implementations of their behaviors.

--

- Inheritance was first implemented in Norway in 1969 for [Simula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simula), considered the first fully object-oriented programming language

---

template: overview

## Benefits
The touted benefits of inheritance include:

--

- Code reuse

--

- Less code redundancy

--

- Easier code maintenance

--

- Conceptual clarity

# Basic Implementation

--

## Abstract Example
Imagine we had the following class, `A` with just a single property, `message`, and its `getter` and `setter` methods.

```java
public class A {
    // no-args constructor
    public A() {
        System.out.println( "A new A object is born!" );
        this.message = "Hello!";
    }

    // just one property to keep it simple
    private String message;

    // getter + setter methods
    public String getMessage() {
        return this.message;
    }
    public void setMessage(String message) {
        if (msg.length > 0) this.message = message;
    }
}
```

---

template: implementation

## Abstract Example (continued)
Another class, `B`, could inherit the properties and methods of `A` by using the `extends` keyword.

```java
public class B extends A {

}
```

- A `B` object could be instantiated with no further code and it would automatically inherit the public interface defined by `A`.

```java
B bObj = new B();
System.out.println( bObj.getMessage() );
```

template: implementation

## Abstract Example (continued again)
When this program is run, two lines are output:
```
A new A object is born!
Hello!
```

--

- The first line above, '*A new A object is born!*' is output by the `A` class's constructor function, which our code does not explicitly call.

--

- All classes, including our `B` class, are given a default **no-args constructor** by Java if no other constructor is defined within them.

--

- This no-args constructor automatically calls **super()**.

--

- If we were to write this constructor for `B` ourselves, it would look like:
```java
public B() {
        super();
}
```

--

- The **super** keyword is a reference to the code in the parent class.

---

template: implementation

## Abstract Example (continued again once more)

The second line output above, '*Hello!*', is a result of the call to the `B` object's `getMessage()` method.

--

- This method, like all other **public properties and methods**, is inherited from the parent class, `A`, into the child class, `B`.

--

- **Private properties and methods** are not inherited by a child class, but can be accessed through public getter and setter methods.

---

template: implementation

## Visibility
By definition, the *private* property, `message`, of the `A` class is not visible from the `B` class.

--

- Yet, the `A` class's getter for that property, `getMessage()`, is public and thus is visible from within the `B` class.

---

name: multi-level

# Multi-Level Inheritance

--

## Concept
We can continue our example by giving `B` its own child, `C`.

--

```java
public class C extends B {

    // a no-args constructor
    public C() {
      super(); // call B's no-args constructor
    }

    // an overloaded constructor that accepts a message
    public C( String message) {
        super(); // call B's no-args constructor
        System.out.println( "A new C object is born!" );
        this.setMessage( message );
    }
}
```

---

template: multi-level

## Analysis
`C` is now a child of `B`, which itself is a child of `A`.

--

- All the **public** properties and methods of `A` are inherited by `B`.

--

- All the **public** properties and methods of `B`, including those inherited from `A`, are inherited by `C`.

--

- Thus, `C` implements the **public interface** of both `A` and `B`.

--

- What would the following code output?
```java
C cObj = new C( "Welcome!!" );
System.out.println( cObj.getMessage() );
```

name: polymorphism

# Polymorphism

--

## Concept
An object or class can assume more than one 'shape'.  

--

- In our example, a `C` object implements the public interfaces of `C`, `B`, and an `A`.

--

- We could say that our `C` object *is* a `C` object, as well as a `B` object, and an `A` object.

--

- It's possible to verify this in code using the `instanceof` operator.

```java
if (cObj instanceof C && cObj instanceof B && cObj instanceof A) {
    System.out.println("It's a C, B, and A object all-in-one!");
}
```

---

template: polymorphism

## Application
Polymorphism can be useful when we want to store a bunch of related objects of different-but-related types into an array or other grouping data structure in order to perform some kind of batch operation on them.

--

```java
A[] myObjs = {
    new A(),
    new B(),
    new C("Welcome!!")
};

for (A myObj : myObjs) {
    String message = myObj.getMessage();
    System.out.println(message);
}
```

template: polymorphism

## Overriding
It is often desireable to have child classes implement the instance methods defined in the parent class somewhat differently.

--

- A child class can define methods with the same signatures as the instance methods in the parent class - this is called **overriding**.

--

- For example, each of our `A`, `B`, and `C` classes could contain different implementations of the `getMessage()` method.

--

- It is possible for a child class's overridden method to call the parent class's version of that same method.

--

- A child class can call any public method as-defined in its parent class's code by using the keyword **super**, e.g.
```java
super.getMessage();
```

# Conclusions

--

You have now extended your understanding of object-oriented programming to include class-based inheritance and polymorphism.
