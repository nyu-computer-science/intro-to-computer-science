## Definition
A computer is any device, entity, or object that can perform computations.

# Programming

## Purpose
> Computer programming is the process of designing and building an executable computer program for accomplishing a specific computing result.

## Levels of abstraction
Programmers have established increasingly higher levels of abstraction in order to make programming faster and more intuitive to humans.

---

Low level:
- Machine languages
- Assembly languages

---

High level:
- High-level programming languages

# Machine code

---

template: machine-code
name: machine-code-1

## Binary instructions
At the lowest level, a programming can directly inform a computer what it should do by sending binary instructions directly to the processor.

---

template: machine-code-1
name: machine-code-2

Example of a set of machine instructions for an x86 processor to move the number 97 to the AL memory register:
```
10110000 01100001
```

---

template: machine-code-2
name: machine-code-3

The number `1011` is the machine instruction to do a move operation, `0000` is the address of the AL register, and `01100001` is the number `97` written in binary.

---

template: machine-code-3
name: machine-code-4

Each family of processors is designed to "understand" particular binary numbers to mean particular operations.

---

name: assembly

# Assembly languages

---

template: assembly
name: assembly-1

## Mnemonics
It's easier for most humans to memorize words than binary numbers.  Assembly languages provide mnemonics that a programmer can write, which are converted automatically to machine language equivalents.

---

template: assembly-1
name: assembly-2

Example of a set of assembly instructions for an x86 processor to place the number 97 in the memory register called AL:
```
MOV AL, 61h
```

---

template: assembly-2
name: assembly-3

`MOV` is a mnemonic for `1011`, `AL` is a mnemnoic for `0000`, and `61` is the number `97` written in hexadecimal notation.

---

## Assembling
Converting code written in assembly language to the equivalent machine language is known as **assembling** - it's essentially a search/replace operation where mnemonics are replaced with their machine code equialents.

The program to do so is called an **assembler**.

# High level languages

---

template: high-level-languages
name: high-level-languages-1

## Abstraction
High-level languages are more intuitive for most humans to read and write.

The written code is further abstracted away from the machine instructions the processor will ultimately execute.

---

template: high-level-languages
name: high-level-languages-2

## Example
Storing the number 97 in a memory register using the C programming language:
```c
register int i = 97;
```

---

template: high-level-languages-2
name: high-level-languages-3

Other high-level programming languages include C, C++, C#, Java, Python, Ruby, Scratch, Javascript, and PHP.  All offer higher-level capabilities, such as looping, functions, branching, etc.

## Translation to machine code
Converting code written in a high-level language to the equivalent machine code is done via one of two processes:
- compiling
- interpreting

---

name: compiling

# Compiling

---

template: compiling
name: compiling-1

Code written in a high-level programming language is translated to its machine code equivalent all at once as a single bulk operation.

---

template: compiling-1
name: compiling-2

- a tool called a **compiler** reads the code, analyzes it, makes optimizations, and outputs a file with the required machine code instructions.

---

template: compiling-2
name: compiling-3

- time-consuming

---

template: compiling-3
name: compiling-4

- efficient

---

template: compiling-4
name: compiling-5

- many errors easily detected during compilation

---

template: compiling-5
name: compiling-6

- processor-specific

---

name: compiling-5

## C language
The C programming language is a classic example of a compiled language.

---

template: compiling-5
name: compiling-6

- There are different compilers to translate C to machine code for each popular processor family.

---

template: compiling-6
name: compiling-7

- The high-level source code must often be tweaked to match the features of the target processor before compiled.

---

template: compiling-7
name: compiling-8

- Not very portable!

---

template: compiling-8
name: compiling-9

- But fast!

---

name: interpreting

# Interpreting

---

template: interpreting
name: interpreting-1

Code written in a high-level programming language is translated to its machine code equivalent *and executed* as a series of small steps.

---

template: interpreting-1
name: interpreting-2

- a tool called an **interpreter** traditionally reads one statement of high-level code at a time, converts it to its machine code equivalent, and immediately executes that machine code.

---

template: interpreting-2
name: interpreting-3

- starts running immediately

---

template: interpreting-3
name: interpreting-4

- not necessarily efficient, since only looking at one-statement at a time

---

template: interpreting-4
name: interpreting-5

- does not traditionally identify errors in statements that have not yet been interpreted

## Write once, run anywhere
Unlike C code, Java source code is highly portable, being executable on machines with almost any processor.  How is this possible?

---

template: java-1
name: java-2

- Java is both compiled and interpreted

---

template: java-2
name: java-3

- Java high-level source code is compiled to **byte code**.

---

template: java-3
name: java-4

- Java byte code is then interpreted to machine code by one of the **Java Virtual Machines** (JVM)

---

template: java-4
name: java-5

- JVMs are created for most popular processor families

---

template: java-5
name: java-6

- Thus Java byte code is highly portable

---

template: java-6
name: java-7

- This is the Java paradigm!

---

template: java
name: java-1

## Write once, run anywhere

## Byte code and the JVM
Byte code is somewhere between machine code and high-level source in abstraction - an *intermediate-level* language.

---

template: java-8
name: java-9

- The Java Virtual Machines are virtual computers (a software simulation a physical computer), which are designed to view byte code as their native machine code.

---

template: java-9
name: java-10

- These JVMs contain within them interpreters which can translate this byte code to the appropriate machine code for whichever physical processessor they are actually running on.

---

template: java-10
name: java-11

- Any programaming language that can be compiled Java byte code can run in a JVM... Groovy, Kotlin, and Scala are popular high-level languages with different syntax from Java that take advantage of this.
