## Purpose
> Computer programming is the process of designing and building an executable computer program for accomplishing a specific computing result.

## Levels of abstraction
Programmers have established increasingly higher levels of abstraction in order to make programming faster and more intuitive to humans.

Low level:
- Machine languages
- Assembly languages

High level:
- High-level programming languages
- [Visual programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_programming_language)

## Binary instructions
At the lowest level, a programming can directly inform a computer what it should do by sending binary instructions directly to the processor.

Each family of processors is designed to "understand" particular codes to mean particular operations.

Example of a set of machine instructions for an x86 processor to move the number 97 to the AL memory register.  The number 1011 is the machine instruction to do a move operation, 0000 is the address of the AL register, and 01100001 is the number 97 written in binary:
```
10110000 01100001
```

## Mnemonics
It's easier for most humans to memorize words than binary numbers.  Assembly languages provide mnemonics that a programmer can write, which are converted automatically to machine language equivalents.

Example of a set of assembly instructions for an x86 processor to place the number 97 (which is written 61 in hexadecimal) in the memory register called AL:
```
MOV AL, 61h
```

## Assembling
Converting code written in assembly language to the equivalent machine language is known as **assembling** - it's essentially a search/replace operation where mnemonics are replaced with their machine code equialents.

The program to do so is called an **assembler**.

## Abstraction
High-level languages are still more intuitive for most humans to read and write.

The written code is highly abstracted away from the machine instructions the processor will ultimately execute.

## Example of storing the number 97 in a memory register using the C programming language:
```c
register int i = 97;
```

Other high-level programming languages include C, C++, C#, Java, Python, Ruby, Scratch, Javascript, and PHP.

## Translation to machine code
Converting code written in a high-level language to the equivalent machine code is done via one of two processes:
- compiling
- interpreting

## Compiling
Code written in a high-level programming language is translated to its machine code equivalent all at once as a single bulk operation.

---

template: high-level-languages-5

- a tool called a **compiler** reads the code, analyzes it, makes optimizations, and outputs a file with the required machine code instructions.

## Interpreting
Code written in a high-level programming language is translated to its machine code equivalent and executed as a series of small steps.

---

template: high-level-languages
name: high-level-languages-8

- a tool called an **interpreter** reads one statement of code at a time, converts it to its machine code equivalents, and immediately executes it.
