# Overview

Arrays are a grouping data structure.

- Multiple values or references can be stored within an array.
- Arrays can store any other data type or data structure, including arrays.

---

name: creation

# Creation

--

## The old-fashioned way

Arrays can be created using the `new` keyword.

- The `new` keyword causes Java to allocate a certain amount of memory for this array, even before it has been populated.

```java
char[] myFavoriteCharacters = new char[3];
myFavoriteCharacters[0] = 'f';
myFavoriteCharacters[1] = 'o';
myFavoriteCharacters[2] = 'o';
```

In this case, Java knows that each `char` value consumes 16 bits, so it reserves enough memory space for 3 of them.

## Using syntactic sugar

Arrays can be created using `syntactic sugar`, or shorthand syntax that is converted to the longer-form automatically by Java upon compilation.

- This can be useful if you know the values you want to put into the array up-front.

```java
char[] myFavoriteCharacters = { 'f', 'o', 'o' };
```

## Using String's split function

Arrays can easily be made from text that contains a particular separator.

```java
String myMessageToYou = "Don't worry about a thing";
String[] words = myMessageToYou.split(" ");
// now you have an array
```

# Array Length

## Counting elements in an array

The `length` property of any array counts its members.

```java
Scanner scn = new Scanner(System.in);
String[] veggies; // reference to an as-yet unallocated array
int num = 0;
while (num < 1) {
    System.out.println("Enter your favorite vegetables, separated by commas: ");
    String response = scn.nextLine();
    veggies = response.split(","); // array is now allocated and populated
    num = veggies.length;
}
```

# Arrays Utility Class

--

## Useful array-related functions

The Arrays utility class is part of the Java API

- provides useful methods for manipulating arrays
- `import java.util.Arrays`

```java
String[] arrVar = { "hello", "and", "good", "morning" };
```

---

template: arrays-class
name: arrays-class-2

## Convert array contents to String

Prints out the contents of the array _inelegantly_.

- Good for debugging.

```java
Arrays.toString(arrVar)
```

```java
Arrays.deepToString(arrVar); // for multidimensional arrays
```

---

template: arrays-class
name: arrays-class-3

## Comparing values in two arrays

Do two arrays have the same set of values?

```java
Arrays.equals(arrVar1, arrVar2)
```

```java
Arrays.deepEquals(arrVar1, arrVar); // for multidimensional arrays
```

---

template: arrays-class
name: arrays-class-4

## Sorting the values in an array

Put them in order.

```java
Arrays.sort(arrVar);
```

```java
int startIndex = 0;
int endIndex = 3;
Arrays.sort(arrVar, startIndex, endIndex); // sort only a subset
```

---

template: arrays-class
name: arrays-class-5

## Searching for a value in an array

One of the popular search algorithms called `binary search` comes with the Arrays class.

```java
String searchTerm = "morning";
Arrays.binarySearch(arrVar, searchTerm); // array must be sorted first for this to work
```

---

template: arrays-class
name: arrays-class-6

## Copying an array

Make a clone.

```java
int newArrLength = 10;
Arrays.copyOf(arrVar, newArrLength); // copy into array of different length
```

```java
int startIndex = 0;
int endIndex = 3;
Arrays.copyOf(arrVar, startIndex, endIndex); // copy only a subset
```

---

template: arrays-class
name: arrays-class-7

## Filling an array

Place default values into an array.

```java
String defaultValue = "foo";
Arrays.fill(arrVar, defaultValue);
```

# Java Is A Pass By Value Language

--

## The word on the street

Some textbooks and online discussions say, "Java is a 'pass by value' language!" What does this mean?

This refers to what exactly is passed to a function when it is invoked with arguments.

---

template: pass-by-value
name: pass-by-value-2

## Primitives are value types

When a _primitive value_ is passed as an argument to a function, the situation is straightforward.

- The argument's _value_ is passed to the function!
- Primitive values are called '**value types**' for this reason.

---

template: pass-by-value
name: pass-by-value-3

## Primitives are value types (continued)

Take the following example:

```java
public static void doSomething(int x) {
    x = 10;
}
public static void main(String[] args) {
    int x = 5;
    doSomething(x); // the value 5 is passed to the function
    System.out.println(x);
}
```

The output of the above program is `5`, since the local variable within the main function is never reassigned to refer to anything other than 5.

---

template: pass-by-value
name: pass-by-value-4

## Arrays and objects are reference types

When an _array_ or an _object_ is passed as an argument to a function, the situation is a bit less straightforward.

- The argument's _reference_ - the memory address at which the array is stored - is passed to the function!
- Arrays and objects are called '**reference types**' for this reason.

---

template: pass-by-value
name: pass-by-value-5

## Arrays and objects are reference types (continued)

Let's consider the following example:

```java
public static void doSomething(int[] x) {
    x = {25, 30, 35}; // the local variable is re-assigned to point to a different memory address
}
public static void main(String[] args) {
    int x[] = {5, 10, 15, 20};
    doSomething(x); // the memory address of the array is passed to the function
    System.out.println( Arrays.toString(x) );
}
```

The output of the above program is `[ 5, 10, 15, 20 ]`, since the local variable within the main function is never reassigned to refer to anything other than that array, and that array has never had its contents modified.

---

template: pass-by-value
name: pass-by-value-6

## Arrays and objects are reference types (continued again)

But consider the following example:

```java
public static void doSomething(int[] x) {
    x[2] = 555; // the third spot within the array is re-assigned to refer to a different integer
}
public static void main(String[] args) {
    int x[] = {5, 10, 15, 20};
    doSomething(x); // the memory address of the array is passed to the function
    System.out.println( Arrays.toString(x) );
}
```

The output of the above program is `[ 5, 10, 555, 20 ]`, since the local variable within the doSomething function is an alias of the variable within the main function - they both refer to the same array in the same memory location and that array's inner values have been modified.

---

template: pass-by-value
name: pass-by-value-6

## Doesn't this mean Java is both a 'pass by value' and 'pass by reference' language?

The phrase, "Java is a 'pass by value' language is thus a bit confusing.

- Arguments that are value types (i.e. primitives) are passed as values
- Arguments that are reference types (i.e. arrays and objects) are passed as references.

The trick to this is that the **references are themselves passed as values** - the value being the integer memory address at which the array or object resides.
