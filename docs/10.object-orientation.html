# Overview

## Concept
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is the standard programming paradigm of today.  Nearly all major contemporary programming languages offer the ability to program with objects.

---

template: overview-1
name: overview-1a

- code is written to represent virtual **things**.

---

template: overview-1a
name: overview-1b

- each thing has certain **properties** (i.e. variables) that belong to it.

---

template: overview-1b
name: overview-1c

- each thing has certain **actions** (i.e. methods) that it can perform.

---

## It's imperative
Object-oriented programming is a variety of **imperative programming**.

---

template: overview-2
name: overview-2a

- The goal of imperative programming is to design code such that one is able to instruct the code to perform a particular action, have it complete that action, and not worry about the implementation details of how that goal was achieved.

---

- This is putting to practice the [black box metaphor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_box ) in engineering, where provided particular inputs a machine produces a predictable output and the user of it doesn't have to know the implementation details.

# Example 1 - Files

---

template: example-1
name: example-1a

Imagine a **file** on a computer's hard drive.

## Properties
Every file on the hard drive might have some properties, e.g.
- the data stored within the file
- metadata: filename, size, date modified, etc.

These properties represent the *internal state* of any given file.

---

template: example-1
name: example-1c

## Actions
If we say a file is in control of its own destiny (a big if), we could say a file has a few actions it could take, e.g.:
- update the data it holds
- change its filename
- save itself to a particular location on the hard drive

These actions represent a *public interface* through which other code can interact with any given file.

---

name: example-1d

## UML class diagram
There is a standardized way of representing such *things*, called the Unified Modeling Language (UML).  Here is an example of a so-called 'class' diagram:

![UML file example](../images/oop-uml-file-example.png)

---

template: example-1
name: example-1e

## Class definition
This diagram can be translated into code as such:

```java
public class File {
    // properties
    private byte[] data;
    private String filename;
    private int size;
    private int modifiedDate;

    // actions
    public byte[] getData() { ... };
    public void setData(byte[] data) { ... };
    public String getFilename() { ... };
    public void setFilename(String filename) { ... };
    public void saveTo(String filePath) { ... };
}
```

---

template: example-1
name: example-1f

## Intention
This **class** definition is a template from which as many file **objects** can be made as we like.
- Each specific File object has its own specific values for each of the properties the class defines.
- Each specific file object will respond to calls to any of the methods that the File class defines.

# Example 2 - Dogs

---

template: example-2
name: example-2a

Imagine a **dog**.

## Properties
Every dog might have some properties, e.g.
- name
- age
- breed
- weight

Different dogs will probably have different values for each of these properties.

---

template: example-2
name: example-2c

## Actions
If we say a dog is in control of its own destiny (a big if), we could say a dog has a few actions it could take, e.g.:
- bark
- fetch
- sleep

Two dogs with different property values might implement these same actions slightly differently.
- For example, a young dog might generally successfully fetch an object, while an elderly dog might generally fail at this
- A breed known for its abilities as a guard dog might bark more often and more fiercely than others.

## UML class diagram
A UML class diagram for this dog thing:

![UML dog example](../images/oop-uml-dog-example.png)

---

template: example-2
name: example-2e

## Class definition
This diagram can be translated into code as such:

```java
public class Dog {
    // properties
    private String name;
    private int age;
    private String breed;
    private int weight;

    // actions
    public void bark() { ... };
    public void fetch() { ... };
    public void sleep() { ... };
}
```

You now have a basic understanding of multidimensional arrays - especially two-dimensional arrays - in Java.
- Thank you.  Bye.
