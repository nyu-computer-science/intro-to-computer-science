# Overview

# Concept
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is the standard programming paradigm of today.  All major contemporary programming languages offer the ability to program with objects.

---

template: overview-1
name: overview-1a

- code is written to represent virtual **things**.

---

template: overview-1a
name: overview-1b

- each thing has certain **properties** (i.e. variables) that belong to it.

---

template: overview-1b
name: overview-1c

- each thing has certain **actions** (i.e. methods) that it can perform.

## Example - file

Imagine a **file** on a computer's hard drive.

---

template: overview-2
name: overview-2a

### Properties
Every file on the hard drive might have some properties, e.g.
- the data stored within the file
- metadata: filename, size, date modified, etc.

These properties represent the *internal state* of any given file.

---

template: overview-2
name: overview-2b

### Actions
If we say a file is in control of its own destiny (a big if), we could say a file has a few actions it could take, e.g.:
- update the data it holds
- change its filename
- save itself to a particular location on the hard drive

These actions represent a *public interface* through which other code can interact with any given file.

### UML class diagram
There is a standardized way of representing such *things*, called the Unified Modeling Language (UML).  Here is an example of a so-called 'class' diagram:

name: overview-2d

### Class definition
This diagram can be translated into code as such:

```java
public class File {
    // properties
    private byte[] data;
    private String filename;
    private int size;
    private int modifiedDate;

    // actions
    public byte[] getData() { ... };
    public void setData(byte[] data) { ... };
    public String getFilename() { ... };
    public void setFilename(String filename) { ... };
    public void saveTo(String filePath) { ... };
}
```

## Example - dog

Imagine a **dog**.

---

template: overview-3
name: overview-3a

### Properties
Every dog might have some properties, e.g.
- name
- age
- breed
- weight

Different dogs will probably have different values for each of these properties.

---

template: overview-3
name: overview-3b

### Actions
If we say a dog is in control of its own destiny (a big if), we could say a dog has a few actions it could take, e.g.:
- bark
- fetch
- sleep

Two dogs with different property values might implement these same actions slightly differently.
- For example, a young dog might generally successfully fetch an object, while an elderly dog might generally fail at this
- A breed known for its abilities as a guard dog might bark more often and more fiercely than others.

### UML class diagram
A UML class diagram for this dog thing:

template: overview-3
name: overview-3d

### Class definition
This diagram can be translated into code as such:

```java
public class Dog {
    // properties
    private String name;
    private int age;
    private String breed;
    private int weight;

    // actions
    public void bark() { ... };
    public void fetch() { ... };
    public void sleep() { ... };
}
```

You now have a basic understanding of multidimensional arrays - especially two-dimensional arrays - in Java.
- Thank you.  Bye.
