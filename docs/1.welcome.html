## Computer science
The study of the theory and practice of computation. Very open-ended.

```python
not programming == computer_sciencing
```

```python
computer_sciencing.find(computers) == -1
```

```python
computer_sciencing not in sciences
```

# What you know you knew

# What you know you knew
## Data types
Programs usually think of data in terms of rigid stereotypes.
- integers
- floating point numbers
- booleans
- strings
- lists
- dictionaries/hash tables/associative arrays
- nonetypes/null/nil

Review [data types](https://knowledge.kitchen/Data_types).
---

# What you know you knew
## Input and output
There are many ways to input and output data from / to external sources.

```python
response = input("What's brown and sticky?")
```

```python
print("'{}' is correct!".format(response.capitalize()))
```

Review [input and output](https://knowledge.kitchen/Input_and_output).

---

# What you know you knew
## Boolean logic and decision-making
Programs can adapt to context.

```python
if this or that and the_other is not also_that:
    thats_wonderful()    
```

Review [boolean logic](https://knowledge.kitchen/Boolean_logic_primitives) and [decision-making](https://knowledge.kitchen/Decision-making_in_code).
---

# What you know you knew
## Functions
Functions are modular blocks of code usually designed to perform a single task.

```python
def thats_wonderful():
    print("That's wonderful")
```

Review [functions](https://knowledge.kitchen/Functions).

---

# What you know you knew
## Modules
A module is a simply a reusable library of code.

```python
# import random module
import random

def thats_wonderful():
    # use a function from the random module
    if random.randint(1,10) > 5:
        print("That's wonderful")
    else:
        print("Okay...")
```

Review [modules](https://knowledge.kitchen/Modules_in_Python).

---

# What you know you knew
## For loop and while loops
You have choices when repeating blocks of code.

```python
for i in range(10):
    print("Welcome!")
```

```python
i = 0
while i < 10:
    print("Welcome!")
    i = i + 1
```

Review [for loops](https://knowledge.kitchen/For_loops) and [while loops](https://knowledge.kitchen/While_loops).

---

# What you know you knew
## Lists
Lists are useful for storing a set of related values.

```python
favorite_foods = [
    "Pizza with glyphosate-coated bleached wheat flour and soy cheese", 
    "Coffee with GMO corn syrup solids added",
    "Emulsified non-fat sugar-free ice cream with artificial sweetener"
    ]
```

Review [lists](https://knowledge.kitchen/Lists) and [more lists](https://knowledge.kitchen/More_Lists).

---

# What you know you knew
## Dictionaries
Dictionaries contain key/value pairs.

```python
phone_numbers: {
    "Foo Barstein": "646-888-5623",
    "Baz Foo":      "212-717-3297",
    "Bar Baz":      "747-211-8451"
}    
```

Review [dictionaries](https://knowledge.kitchen/Dictionaries) and [more dictionaries](https://knowledge.kitchen/More_dictionaries).

---

# What you know you knew
## Text files
Data can be stored and retrieved from text files.

```python
# open file in read mode
f = open('data.csv', 'r')
```

```python
# print out each line of the file
for line in f:
    data = line.split(",")
```

Review [text files](https://knowledge.kitchen/Text_files_in_Python).

---

# What you know you knew
## Strings
Languages offer many ways to analyze and manipulate text data.

```python
text = "This,That,The other"
text = text.lower()
pos = text.find(",")
if pos > 0:
    data = text.split(",")
```

Review [strings](https://knowledge.kitchen/Strings) and [string formatting](https://knowledge.kitchen/Python_string_format_function_examples).

---

# What you didn't know you knew

---

# What you didn't know you knew
## Variables, literals, expressions, and function calls
There are many ways to express value in programs.

```python
"I am literally a literal"
```

```python
I_am_not
```

```python
math.pow(washington, 2) + park
```

Review [variables, literals, and expressions](https://knowledge.kitchen/Variables,_literals,_and_expressions).

---

# What you didn't know you knew
## Dot notation
Dots indicate belongingness.

```python
random.randint(5, 10)
```

```python
math.pow(2, 2)
```

```python
'help me'.islower()
```

---

# What you didn't know you knew
## Other languages
Try to convince me that you don't understand this code:
```javascript
let x = 5;
let y = true;
if (x < 10 and y == true) {
    console.log("Easy peasy!");
}
```

```java
int x = 5;
boolean y = true;
if (x < 10 and y == true) {
    System.out.println("Easy peasy!");
}
```

---

# What you knew you didn't know

---

# What you knew you didn't know
A popular way to think about programs with interacting parts.
- Object-oriented programming

```python
you = new Student("Jane Doe")
```

```python
me = new Professor("Foo Barstein")
```

```python
me.say_hello(you)
```

# Conclusions
- Welcome!
- Start to think like a compiler... or is it an interpreter?

```python
print("There's no reason to worry... {}".format("yet!"))
```
