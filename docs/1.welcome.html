# Introductions

## This course
Introduction to Computer Science

## Me
Foo Barstein

## You
Probably an aspiring programmer.  Perhaps an aspiring computer scientist.

```python
not programming == computer_sciencing
```

---

# What you knew you knew
- Data types
- Input and output
- Boolean logic and decision-making in code
- Functions
- Modules
- For loops and While loops and both
- Lists
- Dictionaries
- Text files
- Strings

---

# What you knew you knew
## Data types
- integers
- floating point numbers
- booleans
- strings
- lists
- dictionaries/hash tables/associative arrays
- nonetypes/null/nil

---

# What you knew you knew
## Input and output

```python
response = input("What's brown and sticky?")
```

```python
print("'{}' is correct!".format(response.capitalize()))
```

---

# What you knew you knew
## Boolean logic

```python
if this or that and the_other is not also_that:
    thats_wonderful()    
```

---

# What you knew you knew
## Functions

```python
def thats_wonderful():
    print("That's wonderful")
```

---

# What you knew you knew
## Modules

```python
import random

def thats_wonderful():
    if random.randint(1,10) > 5:
        print("That's wonderful")
    else:
        print("Okay...")
```

---

# What you knew you knew
## For loop and while loops

```python
for i in range(10):
    print("Welcome!")
```

```python
i = 0
while i < 10:
    print("Welcome!")
    i = i + 1
```

---

# What you knew you knew
## Lists

```python
favorite_foods = [
    "Pizza with glyphosate-coated bleached wheat flour", 
    "Coffee with GMO corn syrup solids added",
    "Emulsified non-fat sugar-free ice cream with artificial sweetener"
    ]
```

---

# What you knew you knew
## Dictionaries

```python
phone_numbers: {
    "Foo Barstein": "646-888-5623",
    "Baz Foo":      "212-717-3297",
    "Bar Baz":      "747-211-8451"
}    
```

---

# What you knew you knew
## Text files

```python
# open file in read mode
f = open('data.csv', 'r')
```

```python
# print out each line of the file
for line in f:
    print(line)
```

---

# What you knew you knew
## Strings

```python
text = "This,That,The other"
text = text.lower()
pos = text.find(",")
if pos > 0:
    data = text.split(",")
```

---

# What you didn't know you know
- Variables and literals
- Dot notation

```python
"I am literally a literal"
```

```python
I_am_not
```

---

# What you knew you didn't know
- Object-oriented programming

```python
you = new Student("Jane Doe")
```

```python
me = new Professor("Foo Barstein")
```

```python
me.say_hello(you)
```

---

# What you didn't know you didn't know
- Basic computer concepts and terminology
- Alias vs copy
- Raw strings
- Recursion

---

# Conclusions
- Welcome!
- Start to think like a compiler... or is it an interpreter?

```python
print("There's no reason to worry... {}".format("yet!"))
```
