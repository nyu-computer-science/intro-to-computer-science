# Overview

---

template: concept
name: concept-1

## Concept
The flow of a program can be controlled such that it deviates from its '*normal*' path.

---

template: concept-1
name: concept-2

- What is a program's 'normal' path?  

---

template: concept-2
name: concept-3

- By default, a program will execute statements in the order written, from top to bottom.

---

template: concept-3
name: concept-4

- Some branches are *unconditional* - the control will always break out of this sequential flow every time the program is executed.

---

template: concept-4
name: concept-5

- Other branches are *conditional* - certain contextual conditions must be met if the control of the program is to break out of its usual flow.

---

template: concept-5
name: concept-6

- Conditional branches are our focus here.

# Flow Charts

---

template: flow-charts
name: flow-charts-1

## Concept
Understanding the flow of a program's control can be visualized easily with diagrams, irrespective of the programming language and code.

---

template: flow-charts-1
name: flow-charts-2

- Writing code is precarious, laborious, and error-prone.

---

template: flow-charts-2
name: flow-charts-3

- Creating such flow diagrams can help understand and communicate the problem being solved without such burden.

---

template: flow-charts-3
name: flow-charts-4

- The [Unified Modeling Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activity_diagram) (UML) has attempted to define the "Activity Diagram" - a standard for how such diagrams should be drawn.

---

template: flow-charts-4
name: flow-charts-5

- In practice, people often use parts of the UML Activity Diagram style mixed with their own personal styles.

---

template: flow-charts
name: flow-charts-6

## Example
A virtual card game program randomly picks two cards, from 1 to 11.  
- If those two cards add up to 21, the program outputs the text "Blackjack!"
- Otherwise, the program outputs the text, "Maybe next time!"

## UML Activity Diagram Rules
UML Activity Diagrams follow a few basic rules:


---

template: activity-diagrams
name: activity-diagrams-1

- program control starts at the top of the diagram and ends at the bottom.

---

template: activity-diagrams-1
name: activity-diagrams-2

- the start point is indicated with just filled circle, the end with a filled circle with a line around it

---

template: activity-diagrams-2
name: activity-diagrams-3

- any process is indicated with an ellipse (or a rounded rectangle)

---

template: activity-diagrams-3
name: activity-diagrams-4

- if any process being diagrammed is so complex it makes the diagram complex and difficult to understand, make a separate activity diagram for that sub-process, and represent it as a single process in this diagram.

---

template: activity-diagrams-4
name: activity-diagrams-5

- any decision point leading to more than one branch is indicated with a diamond shape (also called a rhombus)

---

template: activity-diagrams-5
name: activity-diagrams-6

- branches should have simple annotations indicating in what decision context they are followed

---

name: ifs

# If/Else if/Else

---

template: ifs
name: ifs-1

*if* statements on their own either execute a particular branch or not.

```java
int card1 = (int) (Math.random() * 11) + 1; // number from 1 to 11
int card2 = (int) (Math.random() * 11) + 1; // number  from 1 to 11

if (card1 + card2 == 21) {
    // if the cards add up to 21...
    System.out.println("Blackjack!");
}
```

---

template: ifs
name: ifs-2

*if* statements followed by *else* blocks can have control flow into one of two branches, depending on a single condition being met or not.

```java
int card1 = (int) (Math.random() * 11) + 1; // number from 1 to 11
int card2 = (int) (Math.random() * 11) + 1; // number  from 1 to 11

if (card1 + card2 == 21) {
    // if the cards add up to 21...
    System.out.println("Blackjack!");
}
else {
    // otherwise...
    System.out.println("Maybe next time!");
}
```

---

template: ifs
name: ifs-3

*if* statements followed by one or more *else if* blocks can have control flow into one of several different branches, depending on multiple conditions.

```java
int card1 = (int) (Math.random() * 11) + 1; // number from 1 to 11
int card2 = (int) (Math.random() * 11) + 1; // number  from 1 to 11

if (card1 + card2 == 21) {
    // if the cards add up to 21...
    System.out.println("Blackjack!");
}
else if (card1 == 1 && card2 == 1) {
    // otherwise if the cards are both ones...
    System.out.println("Snake eyes!");
}
else {
    // otherwise...
    System.out.println("Maybe next time!");
}
```

name: switch-case

# Switch/Case

---

template: switch-case
name: switch-case-1

In Java, an alternative to if/else if/else statements are switch/case statements.

---

template: switch-case-1
name: switch-case-2

- these can be easier to read and write in particular situations.

---

template: switch-case-2
name: switch-case-3

- such as when the branch followed depends upon the value of a single variable
- and when multiple conditions lead to the same branch

---

template: switch-case
name: switch-case-4

 You now have a basic understanding of UML activity diagrams, if/else if/else statements, and switch/case statements.
- Thank you.  Bye.
