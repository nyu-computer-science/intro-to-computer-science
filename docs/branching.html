# Branching
> Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
> And sorry I could not travel both
> And be one traveler, long I stood
> And looked down one as far as I could
> To where it bent in the undergrowth;

# Overview

---

template: concept
name: concept-1

## Concept
The flow of a program can be controlled such that it deviates from its '*normal*' path.

---

template: concept-1
name: concept-2

- What is a program's 'normal' path?  

---

template: concept-1
name: concept-2

- By default, a program will execute statements in the order written, from top to bottom.

---

template: concept-2
name: concept-3

- Some branches are *unconditional* - the control will always break out of this sequential flow every time the program is executed.

---

- Other branches are *conditional* - certain contextual conditions must be met if the control of the program is to break out of its usual flow.

---

- Conditional branches are our focus here.

# Flow Charts

## Concept
Understanding the flow of a program's control can be visualized easily with diagrams, irrespective of the programming language and code.

---

- Writing code is precarious, laborious, and error-prone.

---

- Creating such flow diagrams can help understand and communicate the problem being solved without such burden.

---

- The [Unified Modeling Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activity_diagram) (UML) has attempted to define the "Activity Diagram" - a standard for how such diagrams should be drawn.

---

template: flow-charts-3

- In practice, people often use parts of the UML Activity Diagram style mixed with their own personal styles.

## Example
A virtual card game program randomly picks two cards, from 1 to 11.  
- If those two cards add up to 21, the program outputs the text "Blackjack!"
- Otherwise, the program outputs the text, "Maybe next time!"

You now have a basic understanding of compiling, interpreting, and the Java paradigm.

Thank you.  Bye.
