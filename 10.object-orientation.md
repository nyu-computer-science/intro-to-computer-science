# Concept
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is the standard programming paradigm of today.  All major contemporary programming languages offer the ability to program with objects.

- code is written to represent virtual **things**.

---

- each thing has certain **properties** (i.e. variables) that belong to it.

---

- each thing has certain **actions** (i.e. methods) that it can perform.

## Example - file

Imagine a **file** on a computer's hard drive.

---

template: overview-2
name: overview-2a

### Properties
Every file on the hard drive might have some properties, e.g.
- the data stored within the file
- metadata: filename, size, date modified, etc.

### Actions
If we say a file is in control of its own destiny (a big if), we could say a file has a few actions it could take, e.g.:
- update the data it holds
- update any of its metadata fields
- save itself to a particular location on the hard drive

### UML class diagram
There is a standardized way of representing such *things*, called the Unified Modeling Language (UML).  Here is an example of a so-called 'class' diagram:

### Class definition
Indeed, this diagram represents a Java class which can be written in code as such, with properties as variables and actions as methods.

```java
public class File {
    // properties
    private byte[] data;
    private String filename;
    private int size;
    private int modifiedDate;

    // actions
    public byte[] getData () { ... };
    public void setData (byte[] data) { ... };
    public String getFilename () { ... };
    public void setFilename (String filename) { ... };
    public void saveTo (String filePath) { ... };
}
```
